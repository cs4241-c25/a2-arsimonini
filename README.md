## Your Web Application Title
My project should meet all of the requirements asked for, for this project.

Firstly and most cruically is the Server and Client functionalities. 
The server and client speak to each other, sending information stored in "appdata". 
This information is all related to video games and peoples preferences/favored game. 
This portion takes up 28% and thus I wanted to make sure I had everything included, 
including the derived derived field. 

After that, the HTML section is the second most important factor. This is of course
including the form that (when completed) leads to an additional row on the results table
(4 points). The results table can be found in two places, one on the index screen, the other
on the seperate results page (4 points). The page in question does validate with a couple of
errors as visible in the photo section of the file and the canvas submission (4 points). Finally,
both index and results page is accessible from all pages via a NavBar (final 4 points).

For CSS, there are various objects styled with id selectors, positioning, font rules and more.
To go through a couple, The NavBar is a named id with the ul, li, li a, etc all updated with rules.
The table and all of it's elements have styling rules as well. Not to mention the labels and inputs for
the form having more color and sizes. Finally, the Headers and Tables are use a flexbox to center them.
I also use a font in each style rule. These are just a couple of examples. (should have enough for all 16 points)

In total, this should make up 60% of the base points.

Aside from that, I also have generated a private repository, I've tested the project in Glitch
I've made the project public (moving it to Glitch), I've double checked the name to make sure it'safe
correct, I've made my final push to GitHub, and I've modified this ReadMe (as you can see).
This make us 25 more points.


## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I have created a single-page app. When the user sends data, it automatically 
updates the data to the clients table. It also does the calculation for the derived field.

- **Tech Achievement 2**: The form can add and delete data on the server, but it also can edit it
using the Edit button. This data is saved across the pages.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I had two people test out the design. Here are their responses:

Test 1
1. Provide the last name of each student you conduct the evaluation with.

Branchaud

2. What problems did the user have with your design?

The user said that it not clearing the data fields was problematic.
The indexes also can change an incorrectly show (after deleting data)

3. What comments did they make that surprised you?

It surprised me that they noticed the indexing. I knew about the other
clearing fields issue.

4. What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?

I'd fix the clearing (I have the code for it), I'd fix the indexing issue.

Test 2
1. Provide the last name of each student you conduct the evaluation with.

Medailleu

2. What problems did the user have with your design?

Editing data required clicking through ones that he didn't want to edit. 
(if you wanted to edit favorite game, then you had to also "edit" favorite
console). He also saw more value in it being for a single user

3. What comments did they make that surprised you?

The single user comment stood out to me in particular. I was considering more
of a form website where people share their favorite games/consoles and then
someone can take data for it. He viewed it as more of a place to database
your own games.

4. What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?

I would fix the edit issue with more time, and maybe make it more user friendly
for one person use.
